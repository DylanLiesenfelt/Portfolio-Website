                            <p>My name is <b>Dylan Liesenfelt</b> and I am a <b>Software Engineer</b>. 
                            I am also a Veteran of the US Navy, where I served as an Aviation Electrician's Mate for H-60 platform helicopters.</p>
                            <p>During my time as an electrician, I learned that I had a talent for problem solving. 
                            So when it came time for my transition out of the military, I could not think of a field more compatible and challenging to me than Computer Science.</p>
                            <p>Thanks for making it to my site, have a look around, and if you want to see some pictures of the goodiest, most handsome doggo, head over to the photo gallery to see my Husky, Forrest.</p>

                                        <p>I forgot to update my blog, I am sorry, but I’ve done a couple things.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Random Story Dungeon (RSD) is now an electron app, I think I’m going to keep it that way instead 
                                            of web page. Haven’t done any actual work on the project's code, but planning wise I have done some work. 
                                            I added information to the ReadMe, some more planning is needed before I go further, but some 
                                            good work is coming.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>This website I have cleaned up some things.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                I got rid of the skills section in the skills/certs section, its now just Certifications,
                                                 I think that makes more sense, my projects will show what my skills are along with my resume.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                “Started” work on the photo gallery, only added the photos and created the JS file to hold the functionality. 
                                                That is probably the next thing i'll work on, and changed the site background.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                I do need to implement the nav bar links, and start working on the contact page.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                            School is another easy week, COP1000C unit 4 this week is all about loops so pretty easy, 
                                            but has fortified my loop understanding not only with python but other scripting languages, 
                                            so pretty solid there. The chapter project should be getting done tonight and going up on 
                                            GitHub. Things are back to being slow besides the next two weeks for work on saturday so 
                                            hopefully I can get farther ahed hoping to finsh COP1000c by end of month or early November.

                                        <p>Well well well, I guess I’m starting a blog. This blog will be a place where I write down what I’ve learned, what I am working on, and future plans/goals.</p>
                                        <p>Right now, I’m working on a vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS choose your own adventure game. Thinking of adding ChatGPT API to append the story, and then random rolls will affect monster spawn, loot, and combat. Might just have an array of preset rooms but the GPT element could add some variety. Maybe make it into a desktop app using electron not sure.</p>
                                        <p>After I finish that I want to make a MEAN and MERN app, and two more using Flutter and tailwind to check them out.</p>
                                        <p>I also want to start working on some certs, like security+, a Python cert, and some AWS and Google certs. Want to start learning Java also.</p>
